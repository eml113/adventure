# ROOM DESCRIPTIONS
## room 1
You are in a long, white corridor. The walls are entirely, unnaturally featureless and smooth. 
## room 2
You find yourself in a white room. There's not much of note here. 
## room 3
The corridor ends, and you catch sight of a stern steel door, heading east. You're so used to the white, that you're almost surprised at the change. What could be behind there? 
## room 4
You pause, taking in the ugly, black scorch marks marring the white walls of the facility. You linger on them for a moment.
## room 5
You enter the next room, and find several aluminum tables. Everything's all sparkly clean. There is no other furniture. 

You place a hand on the nearest table. It's cold to the touch. Undeterred, your fingers trace the counter's raised edges, and you notice that the surface is slanting downward ever so-slightly. There's some piping at the table's base. 
## room 6
You are in a long, white corridor. You frown. Everything's starting to look the same. 
## room 7
The door creaks as you push onward. You stare at the room with wide eyes. 

A large chunk of the wall is just...gone. Exposed wires spark dangerously, the rubber insulation burnt through. A black, corrosive char covers the parts of the wall that remain, along with, oddly enough, splatters of blue. 

You carefully climb over chunks of debris. 
## room 8
You are in an unassuming, white room. There are four doors in every direction.  
## room 9
You enter the next room, straining to see in the dim light. The power here must be on the fritz——half the lights are off, and the other half are flickering. It makes you feel uneasy. You'd rather move on. 

Which way to go next...there's a keypad next to the south door, but odds are good that it's as glitchy as the lights. There's a humming noise coming from the room to the east. 
## room 10
There are no signs of destruction here. Just the color blue, smeared like a brush stroke along the ground. 
## room 11
You're in some sort of alcove. It's a tight fit, and warm. Heat radiates from the androids chassis, and you think you can hear their internal cooling fans whirring. Their system is working overtime, desperately trying to keep them functional. You wonder how much time they have left.
## room 12
You punch a few numbers into the keypad. For a promising moment, the keypad lights up. Then it bursts into flames. 

You jerk backward from the sudden heat. Shit. Probably shouldn't do that again. 

You sigh, roll up your sleeves, and start pulling. Painstakingly, inch by inch, you work the door open. Eventually, there is enough room for you to slide through. You kind of feel like collapsing into a puddle and never moving again, but you shimmy your way inside. The door clanks shut behind you. 

Within, is a wall of blue. It's some sort of liquid, you realize, thick and viscous and vibrant, churning within a tank. A handful of empty tubs are stacked here and there along the walls. 

After the novelty of color wears off, you mostly feel disappointed. All that effort to enter a glorified storage room. What a waste of time. 
## room 13
Hazmat suits and googles hang on hooks along the walls. You side step some empty tubs to get to the sink sitting in the corner of the room, and you take a moment to wash some of the grime from your arms and forearms. You tilt your head downward to take a sip too, then grimace. The water is really metallic. Gross. 
## room 14
Your gaze trails upward, and your eyes catch on a vent. Ah. The humming noise you noticed earlier. You wonder where it lets out. It's high up on the eastern wall, but if you tiptoed you could probably reach it.
## screwdriver in tree
The vent is exposed. You could probably climb up, and squeeze in there. 
## room 15
You find yourself in a room full of cubicles. You peer into the nearest one. There are no pictures or personal effects or even a computer, though there is a stale, half-eaten sandwich, left unattended. 

You have never felt the absence of people so keenly. It's almost enough to make you want to turn back, and listen to the voice again. 
## screwdriver in tree
The vent is exposed. You can bend down, and crawl back through if you'd like. 
## room 16
You exit the cubicles, and find yourself in a hall. You see a staircase to the south. 
## room 17
The room's stained red. A robotic voice blares. 

INTRUDER ALERT. INTRUDER ALERT. INTRUDER ALERT. 
## room 18
You find yourself in a lobby. A receptionist's desk rests in the corner, and couches are littered here and there. You feel tempted to collapse into one of them yourself, but you need to keep moving. 

To the south, you catch sight of a gold nameplate, fastened to the door. It reads: Ms. Christina P. Ulrich 
## room 19
You find yourself in Ms. Ulrich's office. There's a nice mahogany desk in the center of the room, atop which rests a computer. 

The garish green carpeting tickles your feet as you take a step forward. 
## room 20
The moment you enter, grey blast doors slide into place, blocking the doors. 

Every muscle in your body is tense as a strange grey mist floods the corridor. You hold your breath as long as you can. But just as you reach the limit of your endurance...the mist recedes. 

You gasp, sputtering as the blast doors rise. 

DECONTAMINATION COMPLETE.  
## room 21
You find yourself in a large, empty room. There is something strange about this room, that you can't put your finger on...

You notice a slot in the wall closest to you. 
## room 22
You are in a small temple room. Each of the walls is decorated with two large vertical lines.
## room 23
You are in a small temple room. Each of the walls is decorated with three large vertical lines.
## room 24
You open the door, and breathe in clean, open air.  

You're outside. You can hardly believe it. You take a step forward. 
## room 25
You are in a small temple room. Each of the walls is decorated with one vertical line and the letter V.
## room 26
You are in a small temple room. Each of the walls is decorated with a large letter V and one vertical line.
## room 27
You are in a small temple room. Each of the walls is decorated with a large letter V and two vertical lines.
## room 28
You are in a small temple room. Each of the walls is decorated with a large letter V and three vertical lines.

Awareness comes to you harshly, an unwelcome guest. Something feels wrong. A bad dream? 

It must be. You can't remember it now. The light stings your eyes, and you blink rapidly, taking a few deep breaths to try and steady the odd sense of panic clawing at your chest. What are you doing here——?

A familiar, gentle chime reverberates through the room, and something within you settles. The sound is familiar, somehow. 

A voice reverberates through the room: "Don't panic. Everything will be alright. If you listen to me, I can help you figure out what to do. Start by going into the south room."
## victory
You want to be free. You let the door shut behind you, sealing the voice away for good. In the distance, the sun begins to crest over the horizon. You don't know exactly what the future holds, but you want to pursue it for yourself. 

You take a step into the light. 

THE END!
## death
The pain is too much. You fall to your knees, hand sinking to clutch desperately at your wounds. Warm liquid gushes through your fingers. Black creeps along the edges of your vision. Your miserable life has just come to an end. Your gaze drifts downward, and your world shrinks to five, shaking, blue-stained finger tips. 

Or has it?
## voice5
"Very good." The praise is warm. The voice seems pleased. "You need to go west next."
## voice4
The voice doesn't let you linger for too long. "You're very close now, just a few more rooms. Go south."
## voice7
"Yes, it's quite a mess, isn't it? I'm sorry dear. Just head on over to the south door, now."
## silence
All you hear is chilly silence. It feels like you've done something wrong. The voice is gone. Or just quiet? 
## brainwash
You stand. You go north. You go east. You go north. 

You find yourself in the room with all those strange steel tables again. You lay down on one, even though the surface is cold enough to turn your skin blue. The ceiling opens and machinery descends: drills and tubes and saws. 

One of the tubes snakes around, latching onto the back of your head. And you don't remember much, after that. 
## voice24
But within the depths of the facility, you hear the voice one last time. "You don't know what you're doing. You don't understand. Here, you can live forever. The possibilities are endless. You're endless! Out there? There's only one possibility--a short, meaningless life. Stay here, and be something more."
## return
You take a step forward, but your limbs shake. The voice is right. What's your plan here? You don't have any family, any money, any knowledge of the outside world...you don't have anywhere to go. 

You turn back, closing the door behind you, and disappear back into the depths of the facility. 

"Very good. Just listen to me, and you'll do just fine..."
# ACTORS
## computer
You sit at the computer, feeling quite nice in Christina's fancy revolving chair. With a start-up noise, the computer comes to life. 

The text on the screen reads: Access code generating...access code generating...access code generated! 

A slot opens, and out from the mahogany desks there juts a small, black disk. Relieved at your luck for once, you slip the black disk into your pocket. 

With that, the computer screen fades to black. 
## bird
Suddenly you hear a terrifying shriek from above. A giant crow is trying to swoop you.
## bird misses
The crow flies very close to your head but disappears without harming you.
## bird hits
The crow manages to hit you and scratches your head.
## dead robot
The robot's remains spark pathetically. You feel kind of bad for it. 
## robot attack
A hulking beast of chrome blocks the door forward. It's eyes gleam crimson, and the robot locks on to you, striking mercilessly swift. 
## robot hit 1
It's too fast for you. The robot's arm connects with brutal force. You feel a sharp pain all over your body.
## robot hit 2
Before you can investigate the room further, thick cables wrap around your ankles, swiping you off your feet and throwing you back to the top of the stairs. You land with a thud. 

Shit. The robot is not so easily avoided. 

It's emotionless voice announces: TARGET EJECTED. MISSION RESOLVED. 
## robot miss
You dodge to the side, just managing to avoid the robot's attack.  
## android wounded
You see a...person? They're lying in a pool of blue, their body curled up in pain. They turns their head towards you and beg for your help. You take several hasty steps forward, smearing the blue liquid all over the soles of your feet.

The voice seems to understand your panic. It assures you: "Don't worry. It's not a person. It's just an android, a defective thing. Dangerous. It's the cause of all that destruction. It's hurt so many people...everyone has had to evacuate." 

As the voice speaks, you move closer, taking a knee at the android's side. It looks up, and you can see the desperation in their gaze. You notice other things, too. Like the red blood coating it's hands, and the machinery exposed by the cuts to its chasis. It's not human. The voice is right about that. 

"We need to get rid of it, make things safe again. Kill the android."
## android pleading
You can tell the android is growing weaker. Still, it pleads for you to help it. It promises to help you too, if you use the patch to fix it's wounds. 

What does it mean by help? Help you do what? 

It's hard to think, with the voice being equally insistent. "Please, it's not safe. The android could recover and cause even more destruction. You need to kill it now."
## android healed
The voice is cold. "You didn't listen."

Meanwhile, the android whispers: "Thank you. Follow me. I know a place where it can't see. I can give you something useful." They stumble over to a hole in the eastern wall, and crawl through, gesturing for you to follow. 

The voice continues, its disapproving words cutting into you harshly. Then, it falls silent. You wince. Did you make the right choice? 
## android forges sword
The android shifts, clawing at a hollow in the wall. You begin to see the edges of a box, something that's been hidden in the wall, but it's slow work. You settle in to wait a while. 
## android gives sword
The android places their hand on the boxes top, and it pulses briefly, before opening. They reach inside, emerging with what looks like a hilt. But there is no blade...? The android seems to sense your confusion. 

"If you press this button here, a blade extends, about the size of a knife. It can't cut through the walls, but it's still a powerful weapon, and you'll need it, if you're ever going to escape this place." They gesture for you to grab the sword, and then lean back against the wall. "I can't go any further. I won't make it. But you'll make it through for the both of us, right?" They smile, and close their eyes. 
## android dies
The android falls still. You waited too long. Your indecision killed it. 

"It seems you're not the best at making decisions, are you?" the voice says.
## dead android
It's best to listen to the voice. It's a defective machine. It's killed people.  

You reach a hand into the exposed machinery of the androids stomach. Blue liquid splutters from the cut sluggishly, and the android jerks about fitfully, it's hands pawing at you. It's too weak to push you away. You grab something within and twist sharply.

The android falls still. Your hands come away sticky and blue, and you sit back, panting harshly in the silence.

"You've done well," the voice says. And you find yourself relieved. Now, everyone is safe, and you can find out what you're really meant to do here. 
# ACTIONS
## eat patch
You begin stuffing the patch into your mouth. Circuitry crunches as you chew, and you barely manage to swallow. After a while, you have eaten the whole thing. It leaves a dry taste in your mouth and a sick feeling in your stomach. You sure hope you didn't need this for something more useful. 
## use patch
Awkwardly, you press the patch over where the pain is at it's most sharp. You're not sure if this is how the patch works, but you still feel a bit better now. 
## fingernails
You try to clean your fingernails with the sword. You almost lose the tip of your pinky.
## code1
You slide the disk into the slot and wait anxiously. Then, the light next to the slot turns green.
## code2
The air glows as the force field is made visible. It's so bright that you have to cover your eyes. Then, the field undulates, flickering for a moment, before fading away entirely. It's gone. 
## thrown out
An invisible force hits your body and you are thrown away. You land on the ground in a heap. A force field? 
## screwdriver
Eagerly, you unscrew the grille of the vent. A little too eagerly, perhaps. As you work on the last screw, the screwdriver breaks in two, nearly cutting your hand open!  

You toss the broken bits to the ground, a bit annoyed. Ah, well. You've maneuvered the grille enough that you should be able to get into the vent no problem. 
## skipping
You crouch down on the ground, and try to spin the screwdriver like a top. It doesn't manage even a single rotation, before clattering to the ground. 

How productive of you.  
## Shadow fight sword
You pull out the empty hilt, and press the button, as the android instructed. Immediately, a brilliant turquoise blade extends, a thing of pure light and energy. You begin to skilfully swing it around, looking like an absolutely badass. Unfortunately, there is no opponent to witness your mastery. A bit embarrassed, you put the blade away. 
## shadow fight fists
You vigorously swing your fists around, dancing like a butterfly. Unfortunately, there is no opponent to receive your powerful punches. You lower your fists awkwardly. 
## heal android
You grimace, affixing the patch to the worst of the damage. Your hands come away sticky and blue. It's enough to allow the android to stand.
